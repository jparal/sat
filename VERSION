# This is the VERSION file for SAT, describing the precise version of this
# release.  The various components of the version number below are combined to
# form a single version number string.

# major, minor, and micro are generally combined in the form:
# <major>.<minor>.<micro>

major=1
minor=1
micro=0

# 'greek' is used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is non-empty, it will
# be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be a numeric.  Common
# examples include a1 (alpha release 1), b1 (beta release 1), sc2005 (Super
# Computing 2005 release).  The only requirement is that it must be entirely
# printable ASCII characters and have no white space.

greek=dev

# If revision=1, then the SVN/GIT revision number will be included in the
# overall SAT version number in some form.

revision=

# If patch=-1, then the SVN r number will be obtained dynamically at a run
# time, either 1) via the "svnversion" command (if this is a Subversion
# checkout) in the form "_r<svn_revision>", or 2) with the date (if this is not
# a Subversion checkout, and the svnversion command cannot be used) in the form
# of "_<date>" in the form of YYYYMMDD.  Alternatively, if 'patch' is not -1,
# the value of 'patch' will be directly appended to the version string.  This
# happens during "make dist", for example: if the distribution tarball is being
# made from an SVN checkout, the value of 'patch' in this file is replaced with
# the output of "svnversion".

patch=-1
