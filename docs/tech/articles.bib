  abstract = {A convenient, fast, and accurate method of solving the one-dimensional Vlasov equation numerically in configuration space is described. It treats the convective terms in the x and v directions separately and produces a scheme of second order in ?t. The resulting free-streaming and accelerating equations are computed with Fourier interpolation and spline interpolation methods respectively. The numerical method is tested witth linear and nonlinear problems. The method is very accurate and efficient. A new method of smoothing the distribution function is given. It reduces the computational effort by artificially increasing the entropy of the system. As a result, the distribution function is smooth enough to be well represented on a given mesh. The methods can be generalized in a straightforward way to deal with more complicated cases such as problems with nonperiodic spatial boundary conditions, two- and three-dimensional problems with and without external magnetic and/or electric fields.}

  abstract = {We present a new simulation code for electrostatic waves in one dimension which uses the Vlasov equation to integrate the distribution function and Ampere's equation to integrate the electric field forward in time. Previous Vlasov codes used the Vlasov and Poisson equations. Using Ampere's equation has two advantages. First, boundary conditions do not have to be set on the electric field. Second, it forms a logical basis for an electromagnetic code since the time integration of the electric and magnetic fields is treated in a similar way. MacCormack's method is used to integrate the Vlasov equation. which was found to be easy to implement and reliable. A stability analysis is presented for the MacCormack scheme applied to the Vlasov equation. Conditions for stability are more stringent than the simple Courant-Friedrich's-Lewy (CFL) conditions for the spatial and velocity grids. We provide a simple linear function which when combined with the CFL conditions should ensure stability. Simulation results for Landau damping are in excellent agreement with numerical solutions of the linear dispersion relation for a wide range of wavelengths. The code is also able to retain phase memory as demonstrated by the recurrence effect and reproduce the effects of particle trapping. The use of Ampere's equation enables standing and traveling waves to be produced depending on whether the current is zero or non-zero, respectively. In simulations where the initial current is non-zero and Maxwell's equations are satisfied initially, additional standing waves may be set up, which could be important when the coupling of wave fields from a transmitter to a plasma is considered.}

  abstract = {Hybrid simulations of a high Alfv{\'e}n Mach number (MA>>1) collisionless perpendicular shock are performed in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. The results are compared to highlight the implicit effects of dimensionality in the simulation model. As in previous work, one-dimensional simulations show that the dissipation mechanism can be identified as reflected ions. Two-dimensional simulations allow the ion temperature anisotropy associated with the reflected ions to be relaxed via a collisionless electromagnetic instability. In the high MA limit, this instability causes the shock front to have rotating magnetic fields with approximately equal amplitudes in each direction as well as large-amplitude density fluctuations. The three-dimensional simulations are similar to the two-dimensional simulations with the exception that the fluctuations at the shock front are significantly smaller. This difference is due to the implied phase coherence in the two-dimensional calculations which is absent in three dimensions. The results of the simulations are compared with spacecraft observations of high MA perpendicular shocks.}

Ionization of the micrometeorite-vapor also contributes to the local plasma.}

This line profile indicates that the bulk of the atmosphere is hot, in agreement with evidence from the image data which indicates a gas at approximately 6000 K (Potter and Morgan 1997 Adv. Space Res.in press). A line profile measured in 1986 (Potter and Morgan 1987, Icarus 71, 472) indicated that the bulk of the sodium was cooler, <1100 K, indicative of possible temporal or spatial variation. Previous estimates if the gas temperature were based on a Chamberlain exosphere model, assuming optically thin conditions. We have used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer program to investigate the velocity distribution in the exosphere. Models will be presented for line profiles simulated for various source processes and will be compared with the line profile and image data.}

  abstract = {Perpendicular collisionless shocks are studied by means of two-dimensional hybrid (particle ion, fluid electron) simulations, with emphasis on the relaxation of the highly anisotropic ion distribution that arises primarily from reflection of some of the incident ions but also adiabatic compression of the other, directly transmitted ions and the related growth of low frequency electromagnetic waves.^It is commonly assumed that the waves are due to Alfven ion cyclotron instability that propagate parallel to the ambient magnetic field (k/sub perpendicular/ = 0) and that the isotropization of the ions due to pitch angle scattering by the waves and the corresponding modification of the wave spectrum is quasi-linear.^It is shown that this is indeed a reasonably good description downstream of the shock front, behind the magnetic overshoot.^However, at the shock ramp there is a large discrepancy between the wavelengths measured in the simulations and those predicted by linear theory, and large density and magnetic field oscillations parallel to the ambient magnetic field are also seen.^By comparing results for both high and low ion beta cases, it is shown that these effects can be understood in terms of obliquely propagating (k/sub perpendicular/not =0) modes, more likely due to the Alfven ion cyclotron instability instead of the (drift) mirror instability, although a more complete explanation awaits the derivation and analysis of an appropriate dispersion relation describing the growth and coupling of low-frequency modes in the inhomogeneous high beta environment of the shock.^The observational consequences of these results and their application to improving nonlocal leakage models for the ion foreshock are also discussed. copyright American Geophysical Union 1988}

[1990](SKH), who attributed the enhancement to diffusion through the surface in the Caloris Basin, from depths of order 10 km. The postulated source rate is much larger than any previously estimated diffusion rate, and if true certainly affects consideration of the origin of other atmospheric species. However, Killen et al. [1991] have pointed out that the claim is not supported by the published observations of K or sodium (Na) as a whole. Sprague et al. [1991] have responded by further hypothesizing the existence of several other sources of gas diffusing out of the regolith, all of which are time variable. In any case the SKH data indicate large variations in abundance, and it is important to understand the cause. With this issue in mind we have examined the available abundance estimates for correlation with possible controlling physical parameters. We have found a significant correlation between the average zenith K column abundance and indices of solar activity, although we are left with the intrinsic uncertainty of a small data set.}
