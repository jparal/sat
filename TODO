Optimizations:

* SetCapacity() for pcle in Array::Load(), Specie::LoadPcles()
* There is something wrong with memory allocation
   uniform plasma flowing in one direction has increasing time per iteration
* MPI is using very small messages to transfer particles
* MPI is using synchronous calling
   Look at timing produced with MPI tracing using Bob's code

* Review order of position/velocity advancing in movesp.cpp
* Is smoothing of _dn in advmom.cpp necessary? I'm not calculating it there.
* When some of the eprocesses and up in the centre of the planet we get:
 Assertion: n < count
 Location:  ../../libs/base/common/array.h:674
* Field:Field is _data == NULL?
* add --with-ldflags option to configure
* communication in pcle is blocking computation by factor of 2
* finish Psi function for divB cleaning (sync,..)
* deal with div E/B != 0 (cleansing, ...)
* check out the first and last steps for dn[af]. are they correct?
* move smoothing into calcmom instead all over the place.
