Concrete simulation applications and utilities utilizing SAT libraries

alfven: Alfven wave simulation traveling in +x direction

hions: hions is Mercury Monte-Carlo simulation of heavy ions (part of my
  Msc. thesis). It reads prescribed fields from the files (generated by hybrid
  simulation) and start to inject particles from the surface of the planet.

ioncyclo: Ion cyclotron instability using CAM-CL code
