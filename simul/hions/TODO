* particle trajectory sensor
   There is a problem when we clean old particles the sensor pickup the fresh
   particles and result animation looks like it started from the begining. The
   workaround is to disable cleaning particles. But in future we should
   remember ids and deal with the problem differently.

* spline particle weighting
   It would be worth to try to weight particle using splite function rather
   then linear weighting. It would probably cost the same amount of time since
   memory fetching is already a bottle neck of the simulation.
